## Offline ML Simulation (Python)

The `ml/smart_farm_ml.py` script trains the crop recommendation and cattle movement
models used by the dashboard. To run it locally:

```sh
cd smart-farm-guardian-main/ml
python -m venv .venv && .venv\Scripts\activate  # or use your preferred env manager
pip install -r requirements.txt                 # see note below
python smart_farm_ml.py
```

Place `Crop_recommendation.csv` and `animal_activity_sample.csv` next to the script
before running. The script reports training accuracy and simulates three monitoring
cycles with alarm output. If you do not want to create a requirements file, install:

```
pandas scikit-learn numpy
```
